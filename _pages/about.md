I am a researcher in Statistics an Machine Learning at the University of Bern 
interessted in using machine learning to guide data acquisition pocesses in the natural 
sciences.

After obtaining a PhD in statistics in June 2023 under the supervision of
[Prof. David Ginsbourger](http://www.ginsbourger.ch/).
at the University of Bern, I am now working as an assistant researcher at the 
[Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/).

Before joining the University of Bern, I obtained an MSc in Physics from ETH ZÃ¼rich and 
worked as a data scientist at SwissRe and as a quantitative risk consultant at Deloitte.


Research Interests
======
####Bayesian Inverse Problems

Most existing probabilistic inversion techniques have been demonstrated on toy models 
but tend to scale poorly when applied to real-world problems. My aim is to overcome these 
limitations, by focussing on two research directions:
* **Large-scale inversion**
Bayesian inversion on large 3-dimensional domains exhibits an exploding memory footprint 
that limits the achievable resolution.
By introducing new ways of looking at posterior covariance matrices of Gaussian processes (GP), 
our team was able to scale GP-based inversion to large, realistic inverse problems such as 
gravimetric inversion for volcanoes.
* **Realistic priors**


####Sequential Uncertainty Reduction

#####Distributed Computing for Large Covariance Modelling
